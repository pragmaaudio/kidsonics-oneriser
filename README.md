- WHERE TO INSTALL PLUGINS ON MACOS -

On MacOS, you may drag-and-drop the plugin files into the following locations:

VST3s:
/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3

AUs:
/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components

(Tip: you can paste the above addresses directly into Finder: press Cmd+Shift+G when in Finder, then paste the address into the pop-up window.)

NOTE: these versions are not currently compiled for Apple Silicon, so may not work correctly if not run through Rosetta if you're on an Apple Silicon Mac.
